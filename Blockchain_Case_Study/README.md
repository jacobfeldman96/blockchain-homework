# Dapper Labs: A Case Study

# What is it?

Dapper Labs is a Vancouver-based software development company that uses blockchain technology as a server for games and for ownership of collectibles. Founded in 2018 by the creators of CryptoKitties, Dapper Labs has gone on to create NBA Top Shot, Cheeze Wizards, Dapper and flow, its native blockchain. Their company mission is to apply blockchain technology to leisure, gaming and recreation. 

Their webapps, CryptoKitties, NBA Top Shot and Cheeze Wizards are hosted both on the Ethereum Network and on flow, and accept cryptocurrency as payment. Their first success, CryptoKitties allows players to collect, breed and sell virtual cats. CryptoKitties' popularity famously clogged up the Ethereum Network in 2017 and can be argued was one of the catalysts for the development of Ethereum 2.0. 


# Why this matters?

Blockchain technology was invented as a financial solution for double spend. However, from it's conception, believers in Distributed Ledger Technology have been trying to apply it to as many different industries as possible. According to statista, the video game industry's market cap is projected to increase to $200 billion US by 2023 and Dapper Labs is pioneering the marriage of the two technological industries. 

There are currently 103 gaming cryptocurrencies listed on cryptoslate. Considering video games already use virtual currency within the games, it is more than possible for blockchain to become the technological platform for this currency to be traded and have value ascribed to it outside of the game. With CryptoKitties, it was more than proven that people are willing to pay for and trade NFT's in a completely digital environment. Thus, it is not unreasonable to deduce that the same fate awaits game currencies.

Additionally, the video game industry has been and continues to be a force for further development in computational hardware and software as consumers are consistently willing to buy higher definition and more realistic experiences in a virtual setting. Dapper Labs' contribution to the technological evolution is their development of the flow blockchain. Unlike traditional blockchain, flow "applies pipelining to blockchains by separating the jobs of a validator node into four different roles: Collection, Consensus, Execution, and Verification." This prevents sharding, like in Ethereum 2.0, and allows for scalability without compromise on speed. 

# Why this may be interesting?

Video games aren't going anywhere any time soon, in fact, the industry is growing. If Dapper Labs can be at the forefront of marrying blockchain with gaming, they will likely have a bright future ahead of themselves.
